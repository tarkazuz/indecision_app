# indecision_app
A react app to help you make a decision based on randomness algorithm

Indecision app

The app allows you to enter different possible options and helps make a decision by applying a random number algorithm to choce from all the options available. Any added option can be remove separately or all options can be removed at once, which casues the options display field, as well as the delete buttons to dissapear from the UI.

The app has been created using React. The react components in place are header, action (which choses the option for the user), add option, option, options, options modal (which displays the chosen item ) and the indecision app component, which renders all of the components together into one app. The JSX interpreter put in place to convert the file into vanilla JavaScrip is Babel and all has been put together by Webpack. Local storage method has been used to be able to keep the data consistant through the page loads.

The page has been styled with a single css file in a colour pallete adapted from 'coolors.co' and a favicon and icon created in the 'favicon.io' generator. User interface is responsive and bears some specific featured for the mobile users to make the experience good on smaller devices too.

The whole project has been developed based on the Indecision app project in the Udemy React course and has been created in the process of following the course
